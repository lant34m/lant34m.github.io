This Repository will be update in around 2023.4

#### Documentation requirements

### [SECTION 1: EXAM REQUIREMENTS](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide#section-1-exam-requirements) 

Specific instructions for each target will be located in your Exam Control Panel, which will only become available to you once your exam begins.

#### [Documentation Requirements](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide#documentation-requirements)

You are required to write a professional report describing your exploitation process for each target. You must document all of your attacks including all steps, commands issued, and console output in the form of a penetration test report. Your documentation should be thorough enough that your attacks can be replicated step-by-step by a technically competent reader.

**The documentation requirements are very strict and failure to provide sufficient documentation will result in reduced or zero points being awarded.** **Please note that once your exam report is submitted, your submission is final.** **If any screenshots or other information is missing, you will not be allowed to send them and we will not request them.**

------

#### [Exploit Code](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide#exploit-code)

If you have not made any modifications to an exploit, you should only provide the URL where the exploit can be found. Do not include the full unmodified code, especially if it is several pages long.

If you have modified an exploit, you should include:

- The modified exploit code
- The URL to the original exploit code
- The command used to generate any shellcode (if applicable)
- Highlighted changes you have made
- An explanation of why those changes were made

------

#### [Exam Proofs](https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide#exam-proofs)

Your objective is to exploit each of the target machines and provide proof of exploitation. Each target machine contains at least one proof file (local.txt or proof.txt), which you must retrieve, submit in your control panel, and include in a screenshot with your documentation. **Failure to provide the appropriate proof files in a screenshot for each machine will result in zero points being awarded for the target.**

The valid way to provide the contents of the proof files is in an interactive shell on the target machine with the or command from **their original location**.`type``cat`

**Obtaining the contents of the proof files in any other way will result in zero points for the target machine; this includes any type of web-based shell.**

On all Windows targets, you must have a shell running with the permissions of one of the following to receive full points:

- SYSTEM user
- Administrator user
- User with Administrator privileges
